## What is Vim

Vim is a command line text editor. A text editor is very different from a document file since docs have padding to make the files run and look the way they do. A text file simply has the text you have in it.
Vim doesn't come automatically installed in ubuntu so we must install it using sudo apt install vim

## What is nano

Nano is also a command line text editor. A text editor is very different from a document file since docs have padding to make the files run and look the way they do. A text file simply has the text you have in it.
